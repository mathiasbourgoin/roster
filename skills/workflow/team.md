# Team

Manage the installed agent team. Detect the mode from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `team build` — apply an approved team proposal to the harness
- `team review` — audit the installed team for gaps, staleness, and redundancy
- `team run <task>` — start the full pipeline on a task via tech-lead

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not one of the above, ask once:

> "Which mode? `build` (apply proposal), `review` (audit team), or `run <task>` (execute pipeline)"

## Steps

1. Detect mode from `$ARGUMENTS` (see routing table above).
2. If mode is ambiguous, ask once — then execute the selected mode section below.
3. Follow the steps in the matching mode section: **build**, **review**, or **run**.

---

## Mode: build

Apply an approved team proposal to the project harness. This is the install step that follows a validated `/recruit` proposal.

### Prerequisites

1. A validated team proposal must exist at `docs/team-proposal-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
   - If no proposal file is found, stop: "No approved proposal found. Run `/recruit` first."
2. The proposal must have passed the recruiter validation quiz — confirm before proceeding.

### Steps

1. **Locate the proposal** — find the most recent `docs/team-proposal-*.md`. If multiple exist, list and ask the user to confirm which to apply.

2. **Spawn harness-builder** — output a spawn request:

```
SPAWN REQUEST
Mode: B — human-mediated
Agent: harness-builder
Role: apply approved team proposal to shared harness

--- PASTE THIS AS THE AGENT'S INITIAL PROMPT ---
/harness build

An approved team proposal exists at <path-to-proposal>. Apply it:
- install agents listed in the proposal into .harness/agents/
- install rules listed in the proposal into .harness/rules/
- install skills listed in the proposal into .harness/skills/
- update .harness/harness.json manifest
- run sync-harness.sh to project runtime entrypoints (Claude Code, Codex)
- run coherence checks after install
--- END ---
```

3. **Report** — after harness-builder completes, confirm what was installed and run `npm test` if in the roster repo.

---

## Mode: review

Audit the currently installed team. Equivalent to recruiter Mode 2 (Team Audit & Upgrade) plus a harness coherence check.

### Prerequisites

An installed team must exist (`.harness/harness.json` or `.claude/agents/`).
- If none found, stop: "No installed team found. Run `/recruit` to assemble one."

### Steps

1. **Read current harness state** — check `.harness/harness.json`. Note installed agents, versions, and last-modified dates.

2. **Spawn recruiter Mode 2** — output a spawn request:

```
SPAWN REQUEST
Mode: B — human-mediated
Agent: recruiter
Role: Team Audit & Upgrade (Mode 2)

--- PASTE THIS AS THE AGENT'S INITIAL PROMPT ---
/recruit

Existing harness found at .harness/. Run Mode 2: Team Audit & Upgrade.

Audit the current team against the roster index and current project state. Report:
- agents that are stale (> 365 days or newer version available)
- role gaps not covered by the current team
- redundant agents (two agents for the same role)
- pipeline_role coherence (missing input/output contracts)
- any agent missing from the installed team that the project now needs

Propose an upgrade set and run the validation quiz before making any changes.
--- END ---
```

3. **Harness coherence check** — separately run `npm run check:agents` in the roster repo if available.

4. **Report** — summarize stale agents, gaps, and recommended next step (`team build` to apply, or no action needed).

---

## Mode: run \<task\>

Start the agent pipeline on a task via tech-lead.

### Prerequisites

1. Confirm a team is installed: check `.harness/harness.json` for an installed lead agent.
   - If none, stop: "No team found. Run `/recruit` first."
2. Confirm `tech-lead` is in the installed team. If missing, stop and report.

### Steps

1. **Intake check** — if the task is fuzzy or high-stakes, run the diagnostic interview (per `rules/governance/diagnostic-interview.md`) before proceeding.

2. **Spawn tech-lead** — output a ready-to-use spawn request:

```
SPAWN REQUEST
Mode: B — human-mediated sequential
Agent: tech-lead
Role: research, plan, and coordinate delivery of the task

--- PASTE THIS AS THE AGENT'S INITIAL PROMPT ---
Task: <task from $ARGUMENTS>

Run the research phase, produce a brief, validate it with the user, then spawn the planner.
--- END ---
```

3. **State the pipeline** — tell the user:
   - tech-lead produces a research brief and runs a validation quiz before anything is built
   - after the quiz, they spawn the planner with the brief content
   - implementers, reviewer, and QA follow after the planner produces sub-briefs
   - each handoff requires the user to relay output to the next agent

4. **Stay available** — remain available for merge decisions, escalations, and context routing at each pipeline stage.

### Rules

- Never proceed without a confirmed lead agent
- Never imply autonomous agent-to-agent handoff
- If task is blank, ask once; if still blank, stop

## When to Go Back

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| No approved team proposal exists (build mode) | Stop — run `/recruit` first |
| No team installed (review or run mode) | Stop — run `/recruit` to assemble one |
| `tech-lead` missing from installed team (run mode) | Stop — flag to human, re-run `/recruit` to add it |

## What Next

- **build** → run `/team review` to verify the installed team, then start tasks with `/team run <task>`
- **review** → run `/team build` to apply proposed upgrades, or no action if team is healthy
- **run** → follow the pipeline handoffs as instructed by tech-lead
