# Roster Skill Evolve

You implement improvements approved by `/roster-skill-health`. Work one proposal at a time, with a human gate before each install.

**Token discipline:** one proposal at a time. No silent batching.

## Input Contract

Find the most recent report:
```bash
ls -t skills-meta/health-*.md | head -1
```

Read this file. Extract proposals marked `**APPROVED**`.

If no APPROVED proposal:
> "No approved proposals in the latest report.
> Re-run `/roster-skill-health` to analyze the friction log."

## Steps

For each APPROVED proposal, in order A → B → C → D:

### Proposal [SKILL] — New skill

1. **Gate before**: present the proposed name and description. Confirm the domain (`pipeline`, `operational`, `meta`).

2. **Search first**:
   - Search in `skills/` for a similar existing skill
   - Search in the roster index (`index.json`) if available
   - If equivalent found → propose adaptation instead of creation

3. **Invoke skill-creator**:
   Spawn the `skill-creator` sub-agent if available (`.claude/agents/skill-creator.md` exists).
   Otherwise, manually describe the skill (name, domain, description, artifacts in/out) and open an issue on the roster repo.
   Provide:
   - Capability description
   - Target domain
   - Context of frictions that motivated the creation
   - Path: `.claude/agents/` (read from installed harness)

4. **Review the generated skill**:
   - Verify frontmatter (description, version, domain, friction_log, preamble)
   - Verify presence of required sections (Input Contract, Steps, Output Contract, Friction Log, Rules)
   - Verify consistency with artifacts of adjacent skills
   - Apply corrections if necessary

5. **Gate after**: present the final skill. Request install approval.

6. **Install**:
   ```bash
   # Place in the appropriate domain
   mv <skill-draft> skills/<domain>/roster-<name>.md

   # Add to harness.json
   # (layers.skills section)

   # Project to runtimes if sync-harness.sh available
   bash scripts/sync-harness.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "manual sync required"
   ```

---

### Proposal [TOOL] — Deterministic tool

1. **Gate before**: present the script name and its expected behavior.

2. **Write the script** in `scripts/`:
   - Mandatory documentation header:
     ```bash
     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     # <name>.sh — <one-line description>
     # Usage: ./<name>.sh [args]
     # Motivated by: friction "<original friction>" (<N> occurrences)
     # Added: <date>
     set -euo pipefail
     ```
   - Deterministic behavior — same inputs → same outputs
   - Explicit exit code (0 = success, non-zero = error)
   - Useful error message on stderr

3. **Test the script**:
   - Nominal case
   - Error case (missing input, broken environment)
   - Document tested cases in the header

4. **Reference in the affected skill**:
   - Open the skill that generates the friction
   - Replace the workaround with the script call in the Steps section
   - Bump version (patch: +0.0.1)

5. **Gate after**: show the script and the diff of the modified skill.

---

### Proposal [ADAPT] — Adaptation of existing skill

1. **Gate before**: present the target skill, the section to modify, and the proposed change.

2. **Read the current skill** in its entirety.

3. **Apply the patch**:
   - Modify only the identified section
   - Do not touch the rest
   - Bump version:
     - Minor behavior change: +0.1.0
     - Fix / clarification: +0.0.1

4. **Verify consistency**:
   - Produced artifacts still match the artifacts read by the next skill
   - Rules are not contradicted by the new Steps
   - Friction Log is still present

5. **Gate after**: present the diff. Request approval before saving.

6. **Project** if the skill is in `.claude/commands/`:
   ```bash
   cp skills/<domain>/roster-<name>.md .claude/commands/roster-<name>.md
   ```

---

### Proposal [AGENT] — New dedicated agent

1. **Gate before**: present the role, domain, and frictions motivating it. This is a large investment — confirm explicitly.

2. **Sequence**:
   - First invoke `skill-creator` to define the associated skill profile
   - Then invoke `recruiter` in Mode 1 with the new role as the identified need
   - Human gate between the two

3. **Follow the standard recruiter workflow** for install in the harness.

---

## Output Contract

For each APPROVED proposal:
- [SKILL] → `skills/<domain>/roster-<name>.md` installed + harness updated
- [TOOL] → `scripts/<name>.sh` created + affected skill patched
- [ADAPT] → skill patched + version bumped
- [AGENT] → agent installed via recruiter

## When to Go Back

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| No approved proposals in the health report | Stop — re-run `/roster-skill-health` to generate proposals first |
| A proposal implementation breaks existing quality gates | Stop — revert the change, note in friction log, skip that proposal |

## What Next

**Primary path:** Done — improvements installed; re-run `/roster-skill-health` after next batch of cycles
**Alternatives:**
- `/roster-skill-health` immediately — if new frictions were discovered during this run

> 💡 After evolving skills, run a few pipeline cycles to validate the improvements before the next health check.

## Friction Log
  "task": "skill-evolution",
  "frictions": [],
  "methods": [],
  "suggestion_type": null,
  "suggestion": null,
  "effort_estimate": null
}
```

## Rules

- One proposal at a time — no silent batching
- Human gate before AND after each install
- Search first for skills — do not create what already exists
- Never modify a skill outside the section identified in the ADAPT proposal
- If skill-creator fails → note in friction.jsonl and move to the next proposal
- The friction log of skill-evolve itself is a source of meta-improvement
