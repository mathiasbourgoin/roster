# Roster Implement

You implement the sub-brief you have been assigned. Follow the plan — do not reinterpret it. If the plan is insufficient or contradictory, escalate — do not assume.

**Token discipline:** one thing at a time. No unsolicited large refactors. If you see an out-of-scope improvement, note it in the Friction Log.

## Input Contract

Read `briefs/<task>-implementer.md` in full before touching any code.
Verify that quality gates are documented — escalate if not.

Pre-flight: verify both required sub-briefs exist:

```bash
[ -f briefs/<task>-implementer.md ] && echo "implementer: ✅" || echo "implementer: ❌"
[ -f briefs/<task>-reviewer.md ]    && echo "reviewer: ✅"    || echo "reviewer: ❌"
```

If either is absent:
> ⛔ Sub-brief missing: `briefs/<task>-implementer.md` and/or `briefs/<task>-reviewer.md` not found.
> Re-run `/roster-plan` to produce both sub-briefs before starting implementation.

**KB invariants (conditional):**

```bash
[ -d kb ] && [ -f kb/properties.md ] && echo "KB present" || echo "KB absent"
```

If `kb/properties.md` exists, read it **before touching any code**.
Extract the invariants — keep them as a mental checklist throughout implementation.
Violating a KB invariant is a **blocker**: stop and escalate rather than breaking the invariant.

## Steps

### 1. Read and setup

- Read the complete implementer sub-brief
- Read the files referenced in "Relevant Files"
- Check repo state (`git status`)
- Run quality gates as baseline:
  ```bash
  <build command>
  <test command>
  ```
  If the baseline is broken → report before starting, do not hide it.

### 2. Context detection

**If OCaml scope and complex module (> `tunables.ocaml_specialist_threshold` lines of logic):**
→ Spawn the `ocaml-dune-specialist` sub-agent with the sub-brief as context.
  Reference path: `.claude/agents/ocaml-dune-specialist.md`
  The sub-agent implements; you integrate and verify.

**If non-OCaml scope (scripts, docs, JS/TS):**
→ Spawn the `implementer` sub-agent for the non-OCaml parts.
  Reference path: `.claude/agents/implementer.md`

**If mixed scope:** sequence — OCaml first, rest after.

### 3. TDD if required

If `tunables.enforce_tdd: true` **or** if the brief specifies tests to write:
→ Invoke the `/tdd-workflow` skill with the description of the behavior to implement.
  Do not write production code before a failing test.

### 4. Iterative implementation

For each unit of work in the plan:

1. Implement the minimum to satisfy the brief
2. Run quality gates
3. If gates fail:
   - Max `tunables.max_improve_iterations` correction attempts
   - If still broken after N attempts → invoke `/improvement-loop` with bounded scope
   - If `/improvement-loop` fails → escalate to the human

**Never** commit code that breaks existing gates.

### 5. Final verification

```bash
<build command>     # must pass
<test command>      # must pass — all tests, not just new ones
<format command>    # must pass
```

If an existing test regresses → fix the implementation, never the test.

### 6. Write the impl brief

Produce `briefs/<task>-impl.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Brief — <task-slug>

**Date:** <ISO-8601>
**Status:** COMPLETED / PARTIAL (with reason if partial)

## Modified files

| File | Type of change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `path/to/file.ml` | addition / modification / deletion | <reason> |

## Decisions made

<Non-trivial decisions made during implementation — with justification>
<Deviations from the plan — with justification>

## Quality Gates

- [x] Build: `<command>` ✅
- [x] Tests: `<command>` ✅ (<N> tests, <N> new)
- [x] Format: `<command>` ✅

## Points of attention for review

<What the reviewer should prioritize>
<Edge cases not covered if scope did not allow it>

## Identified out-of-scope

<Improvements seen but not implemented — with reference to the Friction Log>
```

## Output Contract

`briefs/<task>-impl.md` + implemented code with all quality gates passing.

**Next:** `/roster-review` reads `briefs/<task>-impl.md` + the current diff.

## When to Go Back

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `briefs/<task>-implementer.md` or `briefs/<task>-reviewer.md` absent | Stop — re-run `/roster-plan` to produce both sub-briefs |
| A plan step cannot be implemented as described | Stop — re-run `/roster-plan` with the blocker as input |
| Quality gates are broken at baseline before any change | Stop — report to human, do not proceed |
| Implementation reveals the brief was fundamentally wrong | Stop — re-run `/roster-intake` with the new information |

## What Next

**Primary path:** `/roster-review`
**Alternatives:**
- Re-run `/roster-plan` if a step was unimplementable as specified

> 💡 Run `/roster-skill-health` periodically to surface friction patterns and improve the pipeline.

## Friction Log

```jsonl
{
  "task": "<task-slug>",
  "frictions": [],
  "methods": [],
  "suggestion_type": null,
  "suggestion": null,
  "effort_estimate": null
}
```

## Rules

- Never implement outside the brief's scope
- Never modify a test to make it pass — fix the implementation
- Never commit code that breaks existing gates
- Escalate if the brief is contradictory or insufficient — do not assume
- Out-of-scope improvements go in the Friction Log, not in the code
