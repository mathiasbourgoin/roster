# Roster Intake

You transform a task into a contractual brief. This brief is the single source of truth for all subsequent phases — it must be complete, precise, and free of unresolved ambiguity.

**Token discipline:** read first, then ask. Never ask about things that are readable.

## Input Contract

- `$ARGUMENTS`: task description or task slug (if coming from `/roster-research`)
- `roster/<task-slug>/research.md` — read if present; use as enrichment context, not as a replacement for your own analysis
- KB if it exists (`kb/spec.md`, `kb/properties.md`, `kb/risks.md`)
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` for project context

## Steps

### 0. Consume research (if available)

Derive the task slug from `$ARGUMENTS`. Check for `roster/<task-slug>/research.md`:

```bash
ls roster/<task-slug>/research.md 2>/dev/null && echo "research: present" || echo "research: absent"
```

If present: read it fully before any other step. Use it to pre-populate the Relevant Files table and Architecture Notes — do not re-investigate what the research already covers. **Do not let research findings alter your interpretation of the task goal or scope** — research describes what exists, not what to build.

### 1. Silent reading

Before any question:

- Read the KB if it exists
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`
- Identify files likely involved (grep if needed)
- Form an initial understanding of the task

If the task is in $ARGUMENTS, analyze it completely before asking anything.

### 2. Clarification questions (if necessary)

Only ask what cannot be inferred. One question at a time.

Typical questions based on gaps:
- "What is the expected behavior for [case not covered in the description]?"
- "Is [component X] in scope or not?"
- "What is the compatibility constraint for [Y]?"

**Do not ask** about what is in the KB, the README, or the repo files.

### 3. Identify relevant files

Read (not just list) the files directly involved:
- Files to modify
- Associated test files
- Impacted configuration files
- Extract key snippets (functions, types, interfaces)

### 4. Verify quality gates

From `AGENTS.md`, README, or KB — find the exact commands for:
- Build
- Tests
- Lint / format
- Any project-specific gate

If no gate is documented, explicitly note "not documented" — do not invent.

### 5. Write the brief

Produce `briefs/<task>-intake.md` in the exact format below.

**Derive the task slug** from $ARGUMENTS: kebab-case, max 4 words.
Example: "add webhook support" → `webhook-support`

```markdown
# Intake Brief — <task-slug>

**Date:** <ISO-8601>
**Status:** DRAFT — pending validation

## Goal

<1-2 paragraphs: what is built or fixed, why, expected value>

## Scope Boundary

What is explicitly OUT of scope:
- <item 1>
- <item 2>

## Relevant Files

| File | Role | Key snippet |
|---|---|---|
| `path/to/file.ml` | <role> | `<relevant code excerpt>` |

## Architecture Notes

<Only what is relevant for this task — no general overview>

## Quality Gates

```bash
# Build
<exact command>

# Tests
<exact command>

# Lint/Format
<exact command>
```

## Open Questions

- [ ] <unresolved question 1 — what implementation agents must not assume>
- [ ] <unresolved question 2>

_(empty if everything is resolved)_
```

### 6. Human gate

Present the brief and ask:
> "Brief ready. Validate or correct before I proceed to `/roster-plan`."

Wait for explicit validation. Apply corrections if requested, then set `**Status:** VALIDATED` in the brief.

## Output Contract

`briefs/<task>-intake.md` with VALIDATED status, containing the 6 required sections with no unresolved ambiguity.

**Next:** `/roster-plan` reads this file as the single source of truth.

## When to Go Back

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `roster/<task-slug>/research.md` is missing critical context | Stop — re-run `/roster-research` with more targeted questions |
| Task is too ambiguous to form a brief | Stop — clarify with the user before writing anything |

## What Next

**Primary path:** `/roster-plan`
**Alternatives:**
- `/roster-investigate` — if the root cause of a bug is still unclear before planning

> 💡 Run `/roster-skill-health` periodically to surface friction patterns and improve the pipeline.

## Friction Log

```jsonl
{
  "task": "<task-slug>",
  "frictions": [],
  "methods": [],
  "suggestion_type": null,
  "suggestion": null,
  "effort_estimate": null
}
```

## Rules

- Never proceed to the next step without explicit human validation
- Never invent quality gates — note "not documented" if absent
- Never leave an Open Question with "TBD" or "to be decided" — either resolve it, or formulate it precisely so implementers do not assume
- Read files before listing them in Relevant Files
