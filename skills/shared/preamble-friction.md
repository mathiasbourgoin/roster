### Friction Log

**Write your entry when THIS phase ends — before you hand off, before you report, before you
stop.** Not at session end. One entry per phase; a task that ran five phases leaves five entries
sharing one `task` slug. Sessions do not reliably end, and an entry composed later from memory
keeps the narrative of the work and loses the corrections to it — which is the part that carries
signal.

Record honestly:
- **frictions** — workarounds, long searches, ambiguities, and every place a confident conclusion
  of yours was later refuted. A user correction is the highest-value entry there is; write it.
- **classes** — the closed vocabulary below, most load-bearing first.
- **methods** used, and any suggestion for a tool, skill, or adaptation.
- **skipped** — any mandated step this phase did not perform, as `"<step>: <reason>"`. A skipped
  step that goes unrecorded is indistinguishable from a step that ran. Omit the key if nothing
  was skipped; never omit it *instead of* admitting a skip.

A run with nothing to report is a **clean run**: `"frictions": []` and `"classes": []`. Log it.
Clean runs are the denominator — without them no rate can be computed, and "zero clean runs" is
then an artefact of the log rather than a fact about the work.

This is not a performance review. It is cross-run memory.

Canonical entry template (append to `skills-meta/friction.jsonl`; set `"skill"` to your
skill's name — extra documented fields like `class_note`, `event` or `mode` are allowed):

```jsonl
{
  "date": "<ISO-8601>",
  "skill": "<skill-name>",
  "task": "<task-slug>",
  "frictions": [],
  "classes": [],
  "methods": [],
  "suggestion_type": null,
  "suggestion": null,
  "effort_estimate": null
}
```

**Friction classes — closed vocabulary.** Pick by *remedy*, not by symptom:

`gate-vacuous` (a check passed while checking nothing) · `evidence` (a conclusion asserted
without, or against, the evidence) · `process-bypass` (a mandated step not performed, absence
unrecorded) · `missing-artifact` (a referenced file absent, untracked, or not installed) ·
`stale-tooling` (tool present but stale/misbehaving) · `agent-isolation` (worktree or
shared-checkout boundary damage) · `parallel-collision` (concurrent agents contending) ·
`schema-drift` (two artifacts disagree about a shape, or a contract is undocumented at the call
site) · `scope` (scoped too narrowly/broadly, or duplicating delivered work) · `git-mechanics`
(a git/forge operation whose real result differs from its reported one) · `human-gate` (a human
decision unavailable, deferred, or handed back) · `runtime-limits` (session limit, compaction,
killed job, rejected tool arity) · `external-dep` (third-party service or machine unavailable) ·
`positive-signal` (**not** a friction — a gate that worked, a discovery; excluded from
clustering) · `other` (requires a non-empty `class_note`).

The list above is the contract — it is injected into this skill, so it is readable wherever this
skill runs. Do not invent values: use `other` plus a `class_note`, which is how the vocabulary
earns its next entry.

Full definitions, one canonical instance per class, and the classification rules live in the
roster source at `schema/skill-schema.md` → *Friction classes*, where the vocabulary is closed
and validated by `scripts/check-friction-shape.js --log`. **That path resolves in the roster
repo, not necessarily in an installed harness** — if it is absent here, the list above is
complete and authoritative on its own; nothing above depends on opening it.
