// (spec: specs/qa-loop-bounding.md, FR-260..286). Mirrors the shape of
// scripts/lib/review/review-convergence-rules.js but is a fresh, minimal
// module — no reuse of review's strike/streak machinery, which QA has no
// analogue for (C-9: QA only needs a round-cap + a process-incomplete
// bookkeeping check).
//
// Module boundary: this file owns the qualifying-cause classification, the
// round-cap violation, and the missing-audit-entry violation. CLI parsing,
// input validation, and orchestration live in scripts/check-qa-convergence.js.

// explicitly name step 3.5 exit 1 or step 4 TUI failures. This spec proceeds
// with them as qualifying (fail-safe direction: more causes qualify -> the
// pipeline escalates to a human sooner, never later). If the human overrules
