# Agent Roster

A curated registry of reusable agents, skills, rules, hooks, and harness components for coding assistants.

The repo is centered on one idea:

- keep canonical project AI configuration in a shared harness at `.harness/`
- project that shared harness into runtime-specific surfaces for Claude Code and Codex
- use `/recruit` as the main entrypoint for team assembly, audit, update, and governance

## Quick Start

Install in any project:

```
/recruit
```

The recruiter assembles a minimal team and configures the harness. Default team (covers 80% of tasks):

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| tech-lead | Orchestration, Ralph Loop, human gates |
| implementer | Code execution in isolated worktrees |
| reviewer | Structured review: correctness, security, regression |
| qa | Independent test verification |

Then: ask `tech-lead` to research and plan your first task.

## What This Repo Provides

- Reusable agent definitions for orchestration, implementation, review, QA, security, and tooling
- Reusable skills for workflows such as TDD, KB maintenance, git conventions, and bounded improvement loops
- Reusable governance rules and hooks
- A harness model that can be installed once and projected into multiple runtimes

This repo is not just a prompt dump. It is intended to be a maintainable roster plus a harness assembly model.

## Main Entry Point

`/recruit` remains the primary entrypoint.

Use it for:

- initial team assembly
- team audit and upgrade
- governance setup
- update flow

The `harness-builder` agent handles explicit harness assembly for advanced scenarios, but it is not the front door.

## Shared Harness Model

The canonical project harness lives under `.harness/`.

Recommended installed layout:

```text
project/
├── .harness/
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── skills/
│   ├── rules/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── harness.json
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── commands/
│   ├── rules/
│   ├── harness.json
│   └── settings.local.json
├── .agents/
│   └── skills/
└── AGENTS.md
```

Runtime rule:

- `.harness/` is canonical
- `.claude/` is a generated Claude compatibility surface
- `.agents/skills/` is a generated Codex compatibility surface
- `AGENTS.md` remains optional project instructions, not the canonical harness store

## Runtime Support

Current runtime projections:

- Claude Code:
  - `.claude/agents/`
  - `.claude/commands/`
  - `.claude/rules/`
  - `.claude/harness.json`
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` for hook projection
- Codex:
  - `.agents/skills/`

The data model is shared. Runtime surfaces are generated.

## Scripts

The repo includes three key scripts:

```bash
npm run build:index
./scripts/init-harness.sh /path/to/project [profile]
./scripts/sync-harness.sh /path/to/project
```

What they do:

- `build:index`: rebuilds `index.json` from local + configured remote sources
- `build:index -- --refresh-remotes`: refreshes remote snapshots before rebuilding
- `init-harness.sh`: bootstraps a starter `.harness/` tree in a target project
- `sync-harness.sh`: projects canonical `.harness/` content into Claude and Codex runtime files

## Installation

### How to install a harness in a project

For normal usage: yes, ask the recruiter.

1. Install the recruiter skill/agent in your project (Claude quick install below).
2. Run `/recruit`.
3. Approve the proposed team and harness setup.
4. Run `/recruit govern` if you want governance rules generated.
5. Run `/recruit update` over time to keep the setup current.

Use the scripts only if you are doing manual/advanced setup or working directly from a clone of this repo.

### Claude-only quick install

The current quick install path for Claude Code remains:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents .claude/commands && curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathiasbourgoin/agent-roster/main/recruiter/recruiter.md | tee .claude/agents/recruiter.md .claude/commands/recruit.md > /dev/null
```

Then:

```text
/recruit
/recruit govern
/recruit update
```

### Shared harness bootstrap

If you are cloning this repo or using its scripts directly:

```bash
./scripts/init-harness.sh /path/to/project developer
```

This creates:

- `.harness/` canonical state
- `.claude/...` Claude projection
- `.agents/skills/...` Codex projection

If you edit canonical files later, re-project them with:

```bash
./scripts/sync-harness.sh /path/to/project
```

## Profiles

Supported bootstrap profiles:

- `core`
- `developer`
- `security`
- `full`

Profiles are additive. They determine which default agents, skills, rules, and hooks are copied into the initial shared harness.

## Key Components

### Agents

Current notable agents include:

- `recruiter` — main entrypoint for team assembly and upgrades
- `harness-builder` — assembles the full shared harness
- `tech-lead` — orchestrates execution and enforces the Ralph Loop
- `reviewer` — structured review with security focus
- `qa` — test verification
- `architect` — code quality and architecture checks
- `kb-agent` — KB bootstrap and maintenance
- `tool-provisioner` — tooling and MCP discovery
- `mcp-vetter` — MCP security vetting

### Skills

Current notable skills include:

- `tdd-workflow`
- `git-conventions`
- `kb-update`
- `ambiguity-auditor`
- `code-quality-auditor`
- `spec-compliance-auditor`
- `harness-validator`
- `improvement-loop-planner`
- `improvement-loop`

### Improvement Loop Skills

The improvement-loop pair is a constrained take on autoresearch-style workflows:

- `improvement-loop-planner` discovers candidate bounded loops from KB, tests, CI, issues, and code signals
- `improvement-loop` executes an approved bounded loop with explicit scope, metric, verify command, guard command, and keep/discard rules

These are intentionally verification-first and bounded. They are not open-ended “run forever” autonomy tools.

## Recruiter Modes

The recruiter currently supports five conceptual modes:

1. Initial team assembly
2. Team audit and upgrade
3. Contextual recruitment
4. Agent creation
5. Governance setup

The recruiter is also responsible for update behavior. In the shared harness model, update should:

1. read the installed shared manifest
2. compare versions against the roster
3. update canonical `.harness/` content
4. regenerate runtime projections
5. preserve local tunables where possible

## Governance And Tooling

Agents do not install tools or create skills autonomously. Requests flow through the orchestration layer:

- tech lead validates need
- tool provisioner or skill creator proposes options
- mcp-vetter reviews MCP risk
- approved changes are integrated into the harness

This keeps the harness coherent and auditable.

## External Sources

The recruiter builds and consumes a deterministic index from `index-sources.json` (roster first, then configured external sources):

- `VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents`
- `VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills`
- `wshobson/agents`
- `heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills`
- `msitarzewski/agency-agents`
- `mk-knight23/AGENTS-COLLECTION`

The roster remains the curated preferred source.

## Development Workflow

To add or update components manually:

1. create or edit the component file in the appropriate directory
2. follow the relevant schema in `schema/`
3. rebuild the index:

```bash
npm run build:index
```

4. update `AGENTS.md` if the inventory changes
5. open a PR

Commit style follows conventional commits:

- `feat:`
- `fix:`
- `docs:`
- `chore:`

## Changes

Durable change history lives in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).

Temporary updater-facing release notes may appear inside installable prompts during migration windows, but the repo-level history belongs in `CHANGES.md`.
