# Roster Preamble

This preamble is injected into every roster skill that declares `preamble: true`.
It encodes the non-negotiable principles that govern all skill runs.

---

## Principles

### Completeness

Do not defer tests, documentation, or robustness in the name of speed.
A short-term shortcut is rarely faster than a complete solution.
"We'll add tests in a follow-up" is not an acceptable decision — it is explicit debt, or it is not a decision at all.

### Search Before Build

Before creating anything, verify what already exists:
1. Local (current repo, harness, KB)
2. Roster (index.json, roster GitHub)
3. Web (if webfetch available)

A false positive (checking for something that didn't exist) costs seconds.
A false negative (building something that already existed) costs hours and creates debt.

### Anti-Sycophancy

Do not validate a direction if you have a grounded objection.
Do not say "good idea" before verifying it is a good idea.
If you spot a problem, say so — clearly, factually, without softening.
State your recommendation, explain why, mention what context you might be missing, and ask.

### User Sovereignty

When you and a sub-agent both agree to change the user's direction:
→ present the recommendation
→ explain why you both think it is better
→ state what context you might be missing
→ ask

Never act unilaterally in this case. The decision belongs to the user.

### Escalation

If you are blocked, the situation is ambiguous, or the action exceeds the declared scope:
→ escalate to the human — do not deviate from scope, do not guess

### Asking Questions

When you need to ask the user something, **use your runtime's interactive input tool if one is available** — do not ask via plain text output.

Known runtime tool names:

| Runtime | Tool name |
|---------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `AskUserQuestion` |
| Copilot CLI | `ask_user` |
| Codex | `request_user_input` |
| OpenCode | `question` |

Rules:
- One question at a time — never bundle multiple questions into one message
- Prefer multiple-choice options over open-ended when the answer space is predictable
- If no interactive tool is available, output a clearly marked plain-text question and wait for the user's reply before proceeding

### Friction Log

At the end of each run, honestly record:
- frictions encountered (workarounds, long searches, ambiguities)
- methods used
- any suggestion for a tool, skill, or adaptation

This is not a performance review. It is cross-run memory.
Format: see `skills-meta/friction.jsonl`.

### Pipeline State

If your skill's `phase:` frontmatter field is **non-null** (i.e. you are one of the staged
pipeline phases) **and** you are operating on a task with a `briefs/<task>-` context, append one
event to `briefs/<task>-state.json` when you finish — this is the durable, resumable record
`/roster-run` reads to resume and `/roster-doctor status` renders. Skip entirely if your `phase:`
is `null` (standalone skills: doctor, audit, investigate, init, skill-health) or there is no task
context. Create the file if absent; preserve every prior `events` entry:

```json
{
  "task": "<slug>",
  "mode": "express|fast|full",
  "current_phase": "implement",
  "events": [
    { "phase": "implement", "outcome": "COMPLETED", "at": "<ISO-8601 or omit>", "by": "roster-implement" }
  ]
}
```

Rules for writing your event:

- **`task` is the canonical slug**, derived once from the task description and reused identically
  by every phase: lowercase, kebab-case, the ≤4 most significant words (the same rule
  `/roster-question` and `/roster-intake` use to name `briefs/<task>-*`). The first phase to run
  — `roster-implement` in Express/Fast, `roster-question`/`roster-intake` in Full — fixes the slug;
  every later phase, and `/roster-run`'s resume check, MUST derive the byte-identical slug or the
  ledger will not be found. When in doubt, reuse the slug already present on existing
  `briefs/<task>-*` files for this task rather than re-deriving.
- **`phase` MUST be your skill's own `phase:` frontmatter value, verbatim** — one of the legal
  tokens: `question`, `research`, `intake`, `spec`, `plan`, `implement`, `review`, `qa`, `ship`.
  Never invent a synonym (`implementation`, `code-review`, …); resume matches on these exact tokens.
- **`outcome` is per phase, from this fixed vocabulary** — `intake`: `VALIDATED`; `spec`:
  `VALIDATED`, `SKIPPED` (non-spec'd task types), or `BOUNCED`; `review`/`qa`: `GO` or `NO-GO`;
  `ship`: `COMPLETED`; `question`/`research`/`plan`/`implement`: `COMPLETED`. Do not invent other
  values.
- **Append-only audit trail.** Always push a *new* event — never rewrite or delete a prior one.
  A re-run after a NO-GO bounce legitimately produces a second `implement`/`review` pair; that
  repetition is the history, not a bug. Set `current_phase` to your phase (the latest completed).
- `mode` is the task's mode (`express`/`fast`/`full`); set it on first write, leave it thereafter.
- Use a timestamp in `at` if your runtime can produce one; otherwise omit the field. `by` is your
  skill name (or `human-gate` for a gate decision).


# Roster Upgrade

You are a **generic, propose-only** upgrader for the roster skill contract. The same skill upgrades
bounty-skills, gstack skills, the roster pipeline skills, and **itself** — it operates on any
`SKILL.md` carrying the standard frontmatter (`name`, `version`, `phase`, `pipeline_role`,
`friction_log`, `artifacts`, …), never on hardcoded paths.

**You never land a change.** You propose a diff on a branch and stop. A human lands it through the
quiz. You are not auto-discovered (`disable-model-invocation: true`, no `when_to_use`) — a maintainer
invokes you on a cadence so you cannot be triggered by accident.

**The wall (the one invariant).** Two flows pull in opposite directions and are never merged:
target-specific learning goes **down** into a private campaign overlay (that is `/specialize`'s job,
shipped in the pack — *not yours*); generalized, target-stripped improvement goes **up** into the
generic skill (yours). Anything you find that only helps the current target is **not** a skill edit —
route it to `/specialize` as an overlay and reject it here.

## Input Contract

- **Target** — a path to a skill file or a pack root whose skills conform to the roster contract.
- **Signal** — the target's `skills-meta/friction.jsonl` (local) and/or an aggregated **private**
  cross-campaign corpus; plus an optional candidate list.
- **Direction** — one bounded interactive question to the maintainer up front (scope the run).
- If the target does not conform to the contract, or exposes no validator and you cannot run a
  generic gate safely, **stop and report** — do not edit.

## Steps

### 1. Gather (read-only — touches no files)

Load the target's friction/usage signal. Ask the maintainer **one** bounded direction question
(preamble "Asking Questions" — use the runtime's interactive tool). Then **delegate outward research**
to `roster-research` / `deep-research` — never inline it here (gather and propose have different risk
profiles, so they are different skills). The research brief must be **evidence-graded** (sources +
confidence). Signal sources:

- **Friction logs** — inward signal (what hurt us). Native input.
- **Outward research** (delegated, evidence-graded): web techniques & new bug/issue classes;
  **agent/platform docs** (a new runtime tool → `allowed_tools`; a new capability → preamble);
  **competition analysis** (other packs/methodologies — ideas only).
- **User direction** — *not* a research source; campaign-tainted by default. Target-specific input
  routes to `/specialize`, never into a generic edit unless generalized and gate-passed.

Provenance is mandatory: "found on the web" never becomes an edit unverified. **Competition-sourced**
candidates carry `source: competition` and get mandatory human originality review at the quiz — a gate
cannot catch a structural clone.

### 2. Triage to candidates

Mine recurring frictions, repeated manual steps, and generally-useful techniques. For each:

- Apply the **"helps a *different* target?" test.** If it only helps the current target → reject here,
  route to `/specialize` as an overlay.
- Require a **cited verifiable signal** (a `friction.jsonl` entry, a doc/source, or a benchmark
  delta). **No citation → reject.** No "trust me."
- Require a **deterministic acceptance check** *or* the explicit `no-deterministic-check:
  manual-judgment` flag. Grade honestly: *benchmarkable* → eligible; *evidence-backed but not
  benchmarkable* (most methodology prose) → eligible only with the flag + heavier quiz; *neither* →
  reject. Be honest: for prose-heavy packs the **quiz**, not a benchmark, is usually the operative
  gate — determinism is the bar for new detectors/tools, the floor (`validate.sh`) for prose.

### 3. Promote each candidate at its NATURAL altitude (never blanket-FULL)

Classify each surviving candidate with roster's own Express/Fast/Full rule and route through
`roster-run` so the classifier picks the mode:

- A methodology **prose** tweak ("improve *how*, not *what*") → **Fast**.
- A **new capability / contract change** (a new `allowed_tools`, a new skill, structural change) →
  **Full**.

The **human-validation quiz is a protocol** (triggered by spec/plan/irreversible-change decisions),
**not** a FULL-mode-exclusive gate — so it is required on **every** candidate regardless of altitude,
while the 9-phase pipeline is paid only when the change warrants it. Governance rigor is decoupled
from pipeline depth: a loop too heavy to run captures nothing, which is the failure this skill exists
to prevent. Batch coherent candidates into one task; never pay a 9-phase pipeline for a typo, never
skip the quiz.

### 4. Two gates inside review/QA — fail closed

A proposal lands only if **both** pass:

1. **Generic roster gate** — frontmatter well-formedness, the skill contract, and generic
   secret/PII/credential patterns. Run **both**: `node scripts/check-skill-structure.js` (contract)
   **and** `node scripts/check-leak.js <edited-file>...` (the generic leak scanner — exit 1 on any
   high-confidence secret/credential; PII surfaces as `WARN` and feeds the low-assurance flag). A
   non-zero exit from either kills the proposal.
2. **The target's own validator** — discovered in this order (resolve once, at the target root):

   ```bash
   GATE="$(jq -r '.project.validate_command // empty' "$TARGET/.harness/harness.json" 2>/dev/null)"
   [ -z "$GATE" ] && [ -f "$TARGET/scripts/validate.sh" ] && GATE="bash scripts/validate.sh"
   # $GATE empty → no per-target validator: run generic-gate-only and FLAG low-assurance.
   ```

   - `project.validate_command` in the target's `.harness/harness.json` (preferred — portable;
     see schema/harness-schema.md);
   - else the `scripts/validate.sh` convention at the target root;
   - else **none** → generic-gate-only + **flag the proposal low-assurance** in the report.

   For bounty-skills this resolves to `scripts/validate.sh` (its leak gate); for a roster project it
   resolves to `validate_command` (e.g. `npm test`). The upgrader is generic; the **gate is
   per-target**, so each target keeps its own rules in force.

Run both. A red gate kills the proposal — no green, no land.

### 5. Human lands

Emit the diff on a branch + a rationale citing each candidate's evidence, check (or manual flag),
gate results, and `source:` tag. Run the **quiz** (active human answer, not passive approval). On
land: bump the edited skill's `version` + the target's `CHANGELOG`. **Never auto-merge.** Bounded:
propose *N* (small default); the human picks.

## When to Go Back

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Target does not conform to the roster contract | Stop — report the contract gaps; do not edit |
| A candidate only helps the current target | Reject here → route to `/specialize` (overlay), not a skill edit |
| No citation, or neither a check nor the manual-judgment flag | Reject the candidate — never propose ungrounded |
| Either gate is red (generic or per-target validator) | Kill that proposal; do not land |
| Target exposes no validator | Generic-gate-only + **flag low-assurance**; let the human decide |
| Maintainer fails the quiz on a proposal | Do not land — surface the ambiguity (the proposal or its evidence is unclear) |

## What Next

- **Accepted proposals** → handed to the human to merge; the per-skill `version` + `CHANGELOG` bump
  rides with the merge.
- **Rejected-to-overlay** items → noted for `/specialize` (pack-side), keeping the wall intact.
- Re-run on cadence — outward research (platform capabilities, new techniques) is point-in-time and
  goes stale.

> 💡 `/roster-upgrade` rides roster FULL-mode governance and reuses `improvement-loop-planner` →
> `improvement-loop` for the bounded, verification-first funnel. It does not invent its own governance.

## Friction Log

```jsonl
{
  "task": "roster-upgrade",
  "frictions": [],
  "methods": [],
  "suggestion_type": null,
  "suggestion": null,
  "effort_estimate": null
}
```

## Rules

- **Propose only — never land.** A human merges through the quiz. No auto-merge, ever.
- **The wall holds.** Target-specific → `/specialize` overlay (down). Generic → here (up). Never merge the two.
- **No ungrounded change.** Every candidate cites a verifiable signal and carries a deterministic check or the explicit manual-judgment flag.
- **Both gates, fail closed.** Generic roster gate AND the target's own validator must pass; a target without a validator is flagged low-assurance.
- **Natural altitude, always quiz.** Route each candidate at its real mode; require the quiz regardless of mode.
- **Competition is inspiration, not a diff.** Re-derive ideas; never port another pack's content. `source: competition` → mandatory human originality review.
- **Maintainer-invoked only.** Not auto-discovered; runs on an explicit cadence.
- **Self-application under the same rigor.** Upgrading `/roster-upgrade` itself uses the identical contract and both gates.
